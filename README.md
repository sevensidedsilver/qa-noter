This project was bootstrapped and created with react

Hopefully it can eventually work in Angular projects or maybe a CMS

###The idea is pretty simple:

At work we use a qa environment for our creative director and other staffs to review dev work.

There's been a few suggestions for how to communicate to the dev team, something less involved than a JIRA ticket.


SO my solution is to make something that can be used on our QA sites. 

A way to right click on a page, insert a note, and have an option to also create a JIRA ticket for that note.
